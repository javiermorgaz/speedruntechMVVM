# Speedruntech

Technical Test for iOS in MVVM

The App must show the folowing information from the api http://www.speedrun.com:

  * A list with the games with its logo and name.
    There is no need to implement pagination.
    
  * When you select a game from the list, the app must open a new screen containing
    information of the first run in the api runs list. The screen must contain:
    - A button to see the video in an outside app.
    - The name of the player (if there is more than one, you must show only the first player’s name).
    - The time of that run.
    - The game’s logo.
    - The game’s name.
